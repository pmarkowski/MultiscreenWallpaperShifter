# Multiscreen Wallpaper Shifter

A tool that takes in a wallpaper, and generates a new image that when set as desktop
background should display properly across multiple monitors.

Under Windows with AMD drivers, running multiple monitors, it is possible to have one
image stretch across all displays by using the "Tile" option for the wallpaper.

Unfortunately, it seems that Windows also always puts the top left pixel at the top
left position of the primary display, regardless of its physical location. The solution
to this is to take the image you want, and cut and move sections and order them in the
same order. This is tedious and seemed like it could be automated.

Multiscreen Wallpaper Shifter expects an image with horizontal resolution equal to
the sum of the horizontal resolutions of your displays.
